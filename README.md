# GedcomGraph canvas

_GedcomGraph canvas_ is a minimal graphical implementation of the Java library [GedcomGraph](https://github.com/michelesalvador/GedcomGraph/issues), made with AWT/Swing.

_GedcomGraph canvas_ can open a Gedcom file (*.ged) and generate a graphic output of a genealogical tree.

_GedcomGraph canvas_ is a simple playground to test _GedcomGraph_, that was primarly created to generate the genealogical diagram of the Android app [Family Gem](https://github.com/michelesalvador/FamilyGem).
